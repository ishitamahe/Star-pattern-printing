# Star-pattern-printing
## Aim
To print the given * pattern
## Theory
Any pattern can be printed by using nested for loops in a C program. Nested for loops are basically, one for loop inside another. There are multiple types of star patterns such as right triangle star pattern, inverted right triangle star pattern, mirrored right triangle star pattern etc. We have used a simple program with nested for loops to execute one such star pattern.
## Algorithm
Step 1:Start. 
Step 2:Take input for number of rows, n desired in the output. 
Step 3:Initialize 3 variables, a,b,c for the for loops. 
Step 4:Assign the value of n to c. 
Step 5:Use 3 for loops, to print the pattern desired. 
Step 6:Print the final pattern. 
Step 7:End.
## Conclusion
In this practical we learn the concept of nested for loops and how to print different types of patterns using these for loops.
